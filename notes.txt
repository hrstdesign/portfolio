My name is Hristo Stoev and I am a self-taught graphic designer based in Bulgaria. I am currently studying aviaton technologies in university and doing design as my passion and hobby.

I started out aged 12 when I found out about Photoshop and have been hooked ever since. I’m highly motivated to satisfy clients’ needs and make their brand/business stand out from the crowd with fine tuned and custom tailored design services. Let’s make something beautiful together!
